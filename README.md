ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the WAX RFP Community!

Weâ€™re using Discussions as a place to connect the members of our community and collaborate on improvements for the WAX blockchain. Here, you can:

- **Propose Enhancements**: Submit your ideas for new products, features or improvements.
- **Ask Questions**: Get help and insights on your proposals.
- **Share Ideas**: Contribute your thoughts and suggestions to enhance existing proposals.
- **Engage with Others**: Participate in discussions, provide feedback, and support other community members' proposals.

### How to Get Started

1. **Introduce Yourself**: Comment below with a brief introduction and share your interests and expertise on WAX.
2. **Submit a Proposal**: Use the RFP template to propose new enhancements or improvements.
3. **Provide Feedback**: Review and comment on proposals submitted by others.
4. **Collaborate and Build Together**: Remember that this is a community we build together ðŸ’ª.

We recommend you build it open sourced and with the MIT licence.
This makes it easier for other developers to step in and help!

Looking forward to awesome proposals and building a stronger WAX community together.
